1. Explain the difference between RDBMS and SQL.
    A relational database management system (RDBMS) is the actual software that stores and manages the data and SQL is the Structured query language that is used to query the Database system. So RDBMS is the system and SQL is the language used to interact with that system.


2. Why do tables need a primary key?
    It serves as a unique identifier for all of the data records in a table and allows for a better search functionality and identification of records in a database.

3. What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.
    It is called the foreign key.

4. What do we need in order to have a many to many relationship between two tables. 
    A new table needs to be used that contains foreign keys that reference the primary key on the related tables.
